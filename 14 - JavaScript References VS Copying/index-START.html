    let age2 = age;

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
     team[3] = 'Neo';

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log(players, team);

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();

    // one way
    team2[3] = 'Roger';
     console.log(players, team2);

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const  team3 = [].concat(players);
    console.log(team3);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    console.log(team4);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    team4[3] = 'yeaaaa'
    console.log(players, team4);
    const team5 = Array.from(players);
     team5[3] = 'yeaaaa'
    console.log(players, team5);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    // with Objects

    const keven = {
      name:  'moi',
      age: 12
    }
    console.clear();
    console.log(keven);
    const fouFurieux = keven;
    fouFurieux.age = 15;
    console.log(fouFurieux, keven);

    // and think we make a copy:
    const leMalade = Object.assign( {}, fouFurieux, {age: 30});
    console.log(leMalade, fouFurieux);

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const nouveau = {
      name:  'moi',
      age: 12,
      social: {
        facebook: '@yea',
        twitter: 'boost'
      }
    }
    console.log(nouveau);
    const dingo = Object.assign({}, nouveau);
    // got and see function cloneDeep for several level to assign in the hash.
    const dingo2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(nouveau));
    dingo2 =

    console.log(nouveau, dingo2);
    // sinon cette solution simpliste et pour les poor men;
